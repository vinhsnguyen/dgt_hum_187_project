						<p>A majority of the drawings in Phong Hoa took place in areas of leisure, parks, or areas with lots of greenery. 
							After that, many drawings looked to take place in homes or in the city. We did our best to infer where each 
							drawing took place but could only make our best inference due to the lack of detail in many of the images.</p>

						<p>Our data shows us that many people spent most of their time at the park, at hom, or inside the city. In many of 
							the images in a park or leisurely area, many of them were taking walks, having a picnic, or playing games which 
							tells us that many people spent time outside of the home and did not spend much time in other places such as work 
							or school. Overall, this helped us understand how people like to spend their time doing more recreational activities 
							rather than work or school. However, we did find that those who seemed to be of higher socioeconomic status often 
							worked more which could allude to the changes in society due to French colonization.</p>

						<p>Typically men wore Western style clothing which primarily consisted of slacks, dress shirts blazers and occasionally 
							hats. Women, on the other hand, almost always wore Ao Dai in every photo and were rarely seen wearing something else 
							even when they were depicted at home.</p>
						<p>To help us guide our narrative, we used the data from our visualizations to help get a design of what we want our 
							characters to look like. For instance, our male main character will often be seen wearing t-shirt and shorts, while 
							occasionally wearing a suit as he gets older. For our female character, she is wearing an Ao Dai throughout the story.</p>
