							<p>Although Diem and her family may seem well off by being able to spend lots of leisure time together, there are still many caveats to the father's occupation. Many people don't have the opportunity to work for such high-prestige and secur jobs.</p>
							<p>For Mr. Vuong, he is constantly overworked and often considers leaving his job. However, it is often easier said than done because he has a family to take care of. If he were to leave his job, that would mean both him and his wife would have to find jobs, leaving his daughter to school and potentially take care of the house in absence of her mother.</p>
							<p>Mr. Vuong eventually came to the decision that he would keep his job but knew that he would rather sacrifice his time to make sure his wife and daughter were comfortable.</p>
