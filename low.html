						<h2>Visiting the School</h2>
						<p>Grandpa visits the school principal with Duc because his parents are too busy to come. But the grandfather has never been at school before, all he knows is that education is something he never got to have, but that it's important — it's the only way up and out of poverty in this society.</p>
						<p>“Duc is an enthusiastic student, he takes the teachers' words seriously…” the principal comments, looking at the student records. “But, he is not focused. How could you get a 40% on the last test? Is something at home distracting him?”</p>
						<p>Duc looks blankly, “I focus on the teacher's words! I help discipline the other kids! I just, forgot that there was a test…”</p>
						<p>Grandpa scolds Duc vehemently in front of the teacher, “How foolish of you! How embarrassing to be wasting Teach Truong's time! If you don't get better grades, see what will happen to you little rascal!” Deep down, Grandpa knows that the night before, Duc's father and mother got into an extreme fight about family finances. He knows that Duc is having a hard time…</p>

						<h2>Grandpa's Story</h2>
						<p>While studying, Duc's grandpa reminisces about how he never got to go to school.</p>
						<p>“When I was your age, I couldn't go to school. I started working from the moment I could remember and school wasn't an option,” he said. “Make sure to study hard and find work to take care of me and your parents.”</p>
						<p>Before this, Duc rarely studied. But after hearing how his grandpa couldn't go to school, he began to study harder to make him and his family proud.</p>

						<h2>His Journey Continues</h2>
						<p>Needs to get used to traveling by train since he doesn't have a car and needs to travel further as he gets older.</p>
						<p>Fast forward 4 years, Duc finally got into the high school he wanted to go to but that school was too far for him and his grandpa to walk to everyday.</p>
						<p>Now, he takes the train alone into the city on his first day of high school.</p>
						<p>Duc thought nervously, “I hope the kids at school like me… I probably have nothing in common with them because I rarely go into the city.”</p>
